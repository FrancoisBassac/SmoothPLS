# NEWS: SmoothPLS

## SmoothPLS 0.1.2 (2026-04-08)

### Core Improvements & Stability
* **Numerical Precision**: Optimized categorical integration in `evaluate_id_func_integral` with stricter relative tolerance (`rel.tol`) and increased subdivisions (1000) for high-order B-splines.
* **Analytic Prediction**: Implemented analytic L2 inner product for Scalar Functional Data (SFD) using `fda::inprod`, replacing discrete trapezoidal integration for near-perfect precision.
* **Safety Checks**: Added time-range assertions in `smoothPLS_predict` to prevent silent errors when predicting on data outside the basis domain.

### Bug Fixes & Refactoring
* **Tidyselect Compatibility**: Fixed deprecation warnings by implementing `all_of()` in data pivoting functions.
* **Multivariate Support**: Corrected logical assertions in `smoothPLS` to properly handle mixed lists of categorical and numerical predictors.
* **Integration Robustness**: Added `stop.on.error = FALSE` in segment integration to handle micro-intervals without crashing the full model.

### Testing
* **Core Test Suite**: Added 70 unit tests covering Theorems (univariate equivalence), score orthogonality, and prediction consistency.
* **Edge Cases**: Added tests for time-mismatch handling and multi-state categorical transitions.
